# OpenSim-Python-Simulation
OpenSim is an open source software system for biomechanical modeling, simulation and analysis. Its purpose is to provide free and widely accessible tools for conducting biomechanics research and motor control science
This code provides python code to simulate several modules within OpenSim without the use of the GUI.
The following modules are represented within this repository:
Scaling,
Inverse Kinematics,
Inverse Dynamics,
Static Optimization,
RRA (Reduce Residual Algorithm),
CMC (Computed Muscle Control),
JR (Joint Reactions for SO and CMC),
PLotting (plotting ID, SO, JR)
